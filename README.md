# 5ManTBC-AtlasLoot

## About

**5ManTBC-AtlasLoot** is a customized version of AtlasLoot tailored for the **5-man TBC server**.

- This addon **only works in English** due to custom items that lack translations in other languages.
- **All foreign loot tables** have been removed to ensure accuracy.

## Compatibility

If you are using addons like **ElvUI**, I've updated the `!Compatibility` addon to prevent **Lua errors** related to `LibBabble-Boss-3.0`.  
ðŸ”¹ **Make sure to overwrite your current `!Compatibility` with the one provided in AtlasLoot.**

Enjoy your adventures in **The Burning Crusade**!
